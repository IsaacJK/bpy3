This is a short installation manual for the Barnacle package. For more
details, we refer to the full manual (in PDF format).


Prerequisites
=============
The Barnacle package is written in Python and works with Python 2.4
(or newer). The only non-standard Python packages required by Barnacle
are numpy and Biopython.

Barnacle runs on any platform where Python and numpy can be
installed. It has been successfully tested on common Linux, Unix and
Windows platforms (including Debian Linux, Ubuntu Linux, Mac OS X and
Cygwin for Windows).


Mocapy is included as a sub-package
===================================
Note that the Barnacle package includes minimal version of Mocapy
0.726 \cite{Mocapy} as a sub-package.


Installation procedure
======================
Barnacle makes use of the standard tool Distutils for installation. To
install the package, you must first unpack it using the command:

  $ tar -xzf Barnacle-0.2.tar.gz

Once the package has been unpacked, the install script setup.py is
located in the extracted directory. The package can now be installed
using the command:

  $ python setup.py install

This will install the package in the standard path for Python
package. If you want to install the Barnacle in a non-standard
location, it can be done using the command:

  $ python setup.py install --install-lib MYPATH

See the help text for setup.py for further options on alternative
installation paths.
