Version 0.21
============

The Barnacle package was update to be compatible with Bio.PDB version
1.53. This version of Bio.PDB introduces support for the 'element'
column in PDB files, but lacks backward compatibility with older
version of Bio.PDB. These changes implies that

 - if the Barnacle package is used with Bio.PDB version 1.53 or newer,
   the 'element' column of the PDB files will be written,

 - however Barnacle is still compatible with older version of Bio.PDB.

The following implementation specific changes has been made

 - The function sAtom has been moved from geometric_conversion to a
   separate module called simple_atom. Two versions of sAtom has been
   implemented, one compatible with Bio.PDB pre 1.53 and compatible
   with Bio.PDB post 1.53. Which function to use is determined by the
   existence of the argument 'element' to the constructor of the Atom
   class in Bio.PDB.

 - Optional arguments for not placing atoms in the sugar ring and in
   the base has been introduced to the function convert_from_dihedrals
   in the geometric_conversion module. Note that the introduction of
   these arguments implied changes in the order in which the atoms are
   constructed. This also changes the order of the atoms in a
   resulting PDB file.

 - Unused optional arguments has been removed from the function
   convert_from_dihedrals in the geometric_conversion module.
