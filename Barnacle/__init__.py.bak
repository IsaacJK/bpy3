"""
A probabilistic model of RNA conformational space.

This package contains a reference implementation of Barnacle: a
probabilistic model of RNA conformational space. The model is wrapped
into the main class Barnacle. This class can be used for sampling RNA
structures that are RNA like on a local length scale.


Relations to other packages
---------------------------
The only non-standard Python packages required by Barnacle are numpy
and Biopython.

Note that the Barnacle package includes minimal version of Mocapy
0.726 as a sub-package.
